## Validator Testing 

### HTML - Index
  - After running through [W3C validator](vl). The index page had several errors regarding the widgets and iframes as a lot of the stlying was included in the HTML, this has been taken out and styled in CSS.
  -The other error shown relates to a section not containg any identifying heading, this section just containted the embedded iframe. To resolve this I removed the section and placed the iframe in a div only.

### HTML - My Predictor 
  After running through [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).There were no errors found.



### CSS - 
  - Only one error was found when running me style.css through the validator [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) This error was caused due to typing being entered in the code rather than the terminal. This had now been removed completely as this code was not needed.

### Responsiveness 
- Using Google Dev Tools to test the website or a range of devices using the ipad and pixel2 as the main marker i was able to get most items responsives, to tidy up any elements I then used some media queries based on two different screen widths to fix any other issues.


### Unfixed Bugs
- There is still a bug on the register page where the bullet points on the benefits section just show a standard bullet point and not an image of the museum. I have been unable to fix this issue. The bullet points did work but stopped unexpectedly
